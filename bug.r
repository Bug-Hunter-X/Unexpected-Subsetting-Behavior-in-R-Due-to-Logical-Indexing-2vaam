```r
# This code attempts to subset a data frame based on a condition,
# but it produces unexpected results due to how R handles logical indexing.

df <- data.frame(x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), y = c(6, 7, 8, 9, 10))

# Incorrect subsetting
subset_df <- df[df$x > 2 & df$y < 9, ]
print(subset_df)

# The issue is that the condition `df$x > 2 & df$y < 9` is evaluated element-wise,
# and might not produce the expected result, especially with more complex conditions.

# Correct subsetting
correct_subset_df <- df[(df$x > 2) & (df$y < 9), ]
print(correct_subset_df)
